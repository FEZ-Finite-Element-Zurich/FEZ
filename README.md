# FEZ (Finite Element Zurich) Roadmap

Vision Statement
- 

Our vision is to create a virtual hub to share modeling workflows for finite element analysis (a modeling method used in biomechanics research). Our website will serve as a place to learn methods (including open access alternatives to commercial software) and form collaborations. The main goal is to form a finite element analysis community across various institutions and disciplines, and to increase access to this modeling methodology.

Milestones
- 

**Create Website**
- [ ] Decide on website host (maybe use Github pages?)
- [ ] Make prototype (decide on general layout, add sections, vision statement, etc)
- [ ] Write up and publish our own worflows/modeling guides (add to github or gitlab, links on website)


**FEZ workshop and Mini-conference (March 2021, mixed format)**
 - [ ] Confirm speaker list
 - [ ] Rent room
 - [ ] Set up recording equiptment
 - [ ] Determine how to host online participants and stream talks (Zoom?)

 **Gain Contributors and Build Community**
 - [ ] Create Slack channel for community (including channels for troubleshooting, collaborations, job ads)
 - [ ] Reach out to researchers about becoming contributors (to contribute workflows)
 - [ ] Organize how these workflows will be shared (current idea is that researchers share on Github or Gitlab and we add links to the website, so that the creator can get credit for their worflow)


 If you are interested in contributing workflows for any stage of the finite element modeling process (including creating initial 3D models), please contact me!


Ideas for contributing via Github:

If you want people to be able to make changes to your protocol, please upload as Markdown (.md) file. If not, please upload a PDF of your workflow.
