# FEZ (Finite Element Zurich)

Vision Statement
- 

Our vision is to create a virtual hub to share modeling workflows for finite element analysis (a modeling method used in biomechanics research). Our website will serve as a place to learn methods (including open access alternatives to commercial software) and form collaborations. The main goal is to form a finite element analysis community across various institutions and disciplines, and to increase access to this modeling methodology. 

*Project is in Progress*

# Instructions for Contributors  

*We welcome contributions of workflows for any stage of the finite element modeling process (including creating initial 3D models)! If you have any questions about using github to upload your workflow, please [email us](fezurich@gmail.com).

## Steps to contribute workflows:
1. Create github account   

2. Make a repository for your workflow   
  - One repository can contain several documents, for example code, instructions (as a markdown file or PDF), etc  

3. When you create the repository, create a README.md file. This will be a summary of your workflow or technique. You can also include the protocol steps directly in the README file. This is also where you can credit other contributors of the workflow and link to papers and datasets. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for some tips on how to format text in .md documents.

4. Add the workflow/protocol. Workflow instructions can be added as different document types depending on whether you want them to be able to be updated. 
  - If you want people (including future you!) to be able to suggest updates to your protocol, you can add the workflow as a Github .md document (as part of your README file or a separate .md file). 
  - If you prefer, you can upload a PDF of your workflow (but any future changes will then require you to re-make the PDF).
  
4. Upload any code as separate documents.

5. Add a LICENSE.md file. Choose a license [here](https://choosealicense.com/) based on how you want the workflow to be used (e.g. are people allowed to modify it? How should they cite it?). Once you pick a license, create a new document in your repository titled "LICENSE.md" and 
  
3. Format your repository for indexing on our website  
  - We will link to all workflows via our website. To make sure your name and description of your workflow shows up correctly, please:
