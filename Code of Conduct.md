## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces including public events.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at fezurich@gmail.com
Please state the names of all people involved, try including screen captures, details on what happened, provide additional context if possible and mention whether it is still ongoing. We are here to support everyone when necessary. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly after which a statement will be published through the various community channels.
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident, therefore their identity will not be revealed regardless of the circumstances.

## Enforcement
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action including warning or expelling the offender in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
